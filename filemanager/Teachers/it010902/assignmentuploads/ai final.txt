1.13 "Surely animals, humans, and computers cannot be intelligent-they can do only what
their constituent atoms are told to do by the laws of physics." Is the latter statement true, and
does it imply the former?

A. It's the subject of a lot of philosophy and controversy. 
Now humans of course can be intelligent, what else could be intelligent if not humans. Otherwise why would the word intelligence exist. Animals? Not sure. They lack language understanding, rational reasoning skills, and probably they aren't aware of their existence. However, animals (even insects) can display amazingly intelligent behaviour.
What about computers. Computers if not yet intelligent, can BE MADE intelligent in the near future. 
The controversy is what intelligence is. Well, intelligence is mainly reasoning and learning new knowledge. 
What about being conscious of one's own existence, feeling emotions, understanding and so on. Can a computer ever do all these things? These behaviours don't matter, because they are internal states. We just need to view the system externally. Emotions, consciousness, understanding, happiness, grief, etc. correspond to internal states or responses to the environment, and computers can be programmed to display those behaviours. They can also be provided with sensory input, with movement, can be made to appear like humans. The possibilities are countless. 
But how can a bit-grinding machine that just manipulates meaningless symbols understand what it is doing? How could it be aware of its existence or feel happiness or sorrow, while it is processing bits at a high speed. I think that the same is the case with humans. The root of intelligence is billions upon billions of nerve impulses and synapses, which in themselves don't have any meaning, but seen together in a higher level of abstraction, result in an intelligent behaviour.
